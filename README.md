# Sellioneer

This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 10.0.0.

## Technologies
Typescript, Angular 10, AngularFire, Angular Material, Bootstrap 4 for frontend, and Firebase (Google),
Firestore (NoSQL), Mapbox (Map creation, customization and interaction with it) for backend.

## Goal
The main purpose of this system for local sale of goods and services is to
connect potential sellers and interested buyers not through expensive stores or
salons, but directly to each other. The task is always on point, because in our
society more and more online stores are opening, which sell their products or
services at a fairly inflated price, although the services or goods are bought three
times cheaper, and the performers of these services can perform their work
directly to customers for a higher pay. Getting more than from centralized sales
from someone else's store is way better not only for a provider, but even for a user
it is much cheaper to get services directly. This is what this system provides.

### Status
*Currently postponed due to creating other cool apps or looking for a awesome dream job.*
